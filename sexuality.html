      Usually we view "sex" and "sexuality" as dirty and taboo terms, when they really shouldn't be! Read this page to
      find information on the different sexualities

  <p><b>Labels :)</b> <br>
    Especially when it comes to the community and society in general, there's a lot of pressure to come up with a label
    or a box to put yourself in. "Gay", "Lesbian", "Bisexual", etc. But as a young queer person, I know personally how
    hard it is to choose one label that will make people assume things for you for the rest of your life. Remember that
    there is nothing wrong with just identifying as "queer" or "questioning" <3. </p> </br>

        <b style="text-align: center;">Lesbian!!</b><br>
        Simply put, a Lesbian is someone who is a non-man who exclusively </br> likes other non-men. Non-binary people
        and other genders who </br> don't necessarily identify as women (except for men) can be lesbians.
