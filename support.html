      Education is just the beginning. Here are more ways to support the LGBTQ+ community.
    </p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Use inclusive language.</b> When referring to people in general, use gender-neutral terms. Don't assume a person's gender or pronouns. Use they/them if you don't know, or ask the person if you can.</li>
    <li><b>Queer people don't owe you their identity.</b> Whether or not someone decides to come out to you (tell you about their identity), respect their decision.
    <li><b>Listen to queer people.</b> We know our own issues best. Don't talk over us; instead, amplify our voices when we call out problems outside of and within the community.</li>
    <li><b>Support queer creators and organizations.</b> Read or watch content made by LGBTQ+ people of different backgrounds. Donate to LGBTQ+ charities if you can.</li>
    <li><b>Remember that being an LGBTQ+ advocate isn't just a one-time thing.</b> There's more to support than resharing a post or joining a pride parade. Never stop educating yourself on LGBTQ+ topics, and never stop taking action for our community.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <b>Links to LGBTQ+ organizations:</b>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a> is a suicide prevention and crisis
      intervention organization for LGBTQ+ youth.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.glaad.org">GLAAD</a> is a media monitoring organization that shares stories from the LGBTQ+ community to promote acceptance.</li>
    <!--will add more later; will also add a section here for support specifically for queer people (like tips and messages)-->
  </ul>
