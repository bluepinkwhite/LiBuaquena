      Education is just the beginning. Here are more ways to support the LGBTQ+ community.
    </p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Use inclusive language.</b> When referring to people in general, use gender-neutral terms. Don't assume a person's gender or pronouns. Use they/them if you don't know, or ask the person if you can.</li>
    <li><b>Queer people don't owe you their identity.</b> Whether or not someone decides to come out to you (tell you about their identity), respect their decision.
    <li><b>Listen to queer people.</b> We know our own issues best. Don't talk over us; instead, amplify our voices when we call out problems outside of and within the community.</li>
    <li><b>Support queer creators and organizations.</b> Read or watch content made by LGBTQ+ people of different backgrounds. Donate to LGBTQ+ charities if you can.</li>
    <li><b>Remember that being an LGBTQ+ advocate isn't just a one-time thing.</b> There's more to support than resharing a post or joining a pride parade. Never stop educating yourself on LGBTQ+ topics, and never stop taking action for our community.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <b>Links to LGBTQ+ organizations and projects:</b>
      <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a> is a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ youth.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.glaad.org">GLAAD</a> is a media monitoring organization that shares stories from the LGBTQ+ community to promote acceptance.</li>
    <li><a href="https://tihp.cave.town">This Is Home Project</a> aims to provide funding to foundations helping LGBTQ+ youth.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>For LGBTQ+ people reading this:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>You are valid.</b> Your identity is valid. You are not broken. There is nothing wrong with how you feel and who you are. You'll be alright. It gets better :]</li>
      <li><b>There's nothing wrong with exploration and experimentation.</b> Change your pronouns! Change your labels! See what fits you the best. No one's stopping you.</li>
      <li><b>You might never have everything figured out, and that's okay!</b> You don't need to know every single aspect of your identity. You don't need hyperspecific labels if that's not what you want, either.</li>
      <li><b>Take care of yourself!</b> Surround yourself with the people and things that make you happy. Don't feed yourself unnecessary negativity. Find healthy coping mechanisms. The world can be tough, but it doesn't all have to be that bad.</li>
    </ul>
