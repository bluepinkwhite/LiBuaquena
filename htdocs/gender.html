      <b>Sex and Gender</b>
      <br>
      Sex and gender aren't the same thing. Sex is based in biology; it has to do with the body you were born in. Gender
      is more of a social construct. It's also important to know that neither sex nor gender are binary. Sex isn't just
      male or femaleâ€”intersex people, whose sex characteristics don't exactly match those of the two categories. As for
      gender, nonbinary people exist, and their gender goes beyond being just a man or a woman.

      <b>Gender Identity and Expression</b>
      <br>
      Gender identity refers to a person's sense of their own gender. Gender expression, on the other hand, is how a
      person shows their gender to others through physical appearance, names, pronouns, and/or mannerisms. A person's
      gender expression may not fit your idea of how someone of their identity would present, and that's completely
      fine!

      <b>Transgender</b>
      <br>
      A trans person is someone who does not identify with their sex assigned at birth. This is not only for binary
      trans people or people who identify as strictly man or woman, but non-binary a people as well.

      <b>Nonbinary</b>
      <br>
      A nonbinary (also written as non-binary) person is anyone who does not identify within the male/female binary.
      This could mean they feel a connection to both, neither, sometimes one or the other, etc.

      <b>Genderfluid</b>
      <br>
      Someone who identifies as genderfluid feels that their gender changes over time. For example, they may feel
      masculine one day, feminine another day, and androgynous the next. It basically means that their gender is
      "fluid."

      <b>Agender</b>
      <br>
      Agender means a "lack" of gender; someone who is agender may feel they are neither man or woman or anything.
