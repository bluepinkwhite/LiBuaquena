      Usually we view "sex" and "sexuality" as dirty and taboo terms, when they really shouldn't be! Read this page to
      find information on the different sexualities

  <p><b>Labels :)</b> <br>
    Especially when it comes to the community and society in general, there's a lot of pressure to come up with a label or a box to put yourself in. "Gay", "Lesbian", "Bisexual", etc. But as a young queer person, I know personally how hard it is to choose one label that will make people assume things for you for the rest of your life. Remember that there is nothing wrong with just identifying as "queer" or "questioning" <3. </p> <br>

  <b>Lesbian!!</b>
  <br>
    Simply put, a Lesbian is someone who is a non-man who exclusively likes other non-men. Non-binary people and other genders who don't necessarily identify as women (except for men) can be lesbians.

  <b>Gay/Vincian :)</b>
  <br>
    I, the writer of this page (Ethan :D) personally use this label because it encapsulates what i feel about my sexuality. I've never been attracted to women and I have been attracted to men and non-binary people. That's what this basically means. In short, a gay man.

  <p>
  <b>Bisexual <3</b>
  <br>
  Bisexual people are people attracted to more than one gender. Contrary to popular belief, the "bi" in bisexual doesn't mean someone only likes two genders, but two or more.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Asexual ^-^</b>
  <br>
  Asexual people are people who feel little to no sexual attraction. No matter what society says, you are valid. You are not broken. There is no piece missing.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <img class="flagRight" src="../images/pan flag.png">

  <b>Pansexual :></b>
  <br>
  Pansexual people are people attracted others regardless of gender. They are open to any or all genders. It is under the bisexual umbrella of liking two or more genders, but identifying as pansexual means you have no preference in terms of gender.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <p><b>I don't resonate with any of these :(</b> <br>
    That's okay! If you want to delve deeper into the realm of identity in terms of sexuality, the labels listed here aren't the only valid ones! If you want a label to describe yourself being generally different from a regular heterosexual orientation, you could always go with "Queer". If you want a more specific label, there are hundreds more out there to choose from, just research!</p> <br>
