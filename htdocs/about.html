      Hi! I'm Ethan and I identify as a gay man. My pronouns are they/he (which basically means you can use either one on me and i'll be happy :>). I have had two ex boyfriends (they are both somewhere around campus) and I have been out of the closet for 2 years. My favorite movie is Everything Everywhere All At Once and my favorite artist is Cavetown. If you see me anywhere around the campus, feel free to say hi! You can also approach me if you have any queer-related issues (or issues in general) and my friends and I will try our best to help <3</p> <br>

    <p><b>BEN ????? (buaque√±a)</b> <br>
      Hellooo!! I'm Ben!! I have like two other names but no one uses them for me ughh. (The names are Zack and Noel if you want to know!) I'm bi, arospec, and transmasculine, and my pronouns are he/they because I can never be her (/joke). I am... not out of the closet, at least not to my family (haha sobs). I'm a nerd, unfortunately. My current obsessions are School of Rock and Ride the Cyclone (I totally didn't steal names from those). My favorite artist is Flower Face! I am not like Ethan. Do not approach me. (That was mostly a joke, but I am really shy :,] I am willing to talk though!!!)</p>
