      <br><br><br>
      There are different types of attraction, and they may be experienced in different ways.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>Attraction</b>
      <br>
      Attraction isn't just about <span style="font-style: italic;">who</span> you're attracted to; it's also about
      <span style="font-style: italic;">how</span> you experience this attraction, and whether you even do experience
      it.
      <br><br>
      As mentioned in <a href="sexuality.html">the page on sexuality</a>, some people don't experience sexual
      attraction. This is called asexuality. Similarly, aromantic people don't experience romantic attraction. Just like
      all other aspects of queer identity, asexuality and aromanticism are spectrums—not everyone will be asexual or
      aromantic in the same way. There are also plenty of other labels in these spectrums, but of course, there's no
      pressure to find one that perfectly fits you!
    </p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="flagRight" src="../images/aromantic flag.png">
    <p>
      <b>Aromantic</b>
      <br>
      Aromantic people feel little to no romantic attraction to others. They may or may not be interested in romance, as
      well.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="flagLeft" src="../images/arospec flag.png">
    <p>
      <b>Aromantic Spectrum (Arospec)</b>
      <br>
      The aromantic spectrum isn't just a line with aromanticism on one side and alloromanticism (the opposite; fully
      experiencing romantic attraction) on the other. There are plenty of different experiences that can't exactly be
      sorted by how much attraction one feels.
      <br><br>
      Arospec can also be used as an identity label for anyone who experiences romance and romantic attraction in a
      nonnormative way! I (Ben :]) have found terms that further specify my aromanticism, but I prefer to use this term
      for myself. (I also think the flag is pretty)
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="flagRight" src="../images/demiro flag.png">
    <p>
      <b>Demiromantic</b>
      <br>
      For demiromantic people, a close emotional connection is needed before they could ever feel romantic attraction to
      someone. This isn't just about wanting to get to know someone before dating them—demiromantic people genuinely
      don't feel romance until they've formed a close bond with someone.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="flagLeft" src="../images/aegoromantic flag.png">
    <p>
      <b>Aegoromantic</b>
      <br>
      Aegoromanticism is about enjoying the idea of romance, but not wanting to actually participate in it. They may
      enjoy romance in fiction, or when it involves people other than themselves.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="flagRight" src="../images/grayro flag.png">
    <p>
      <b>Grayromantic</b>
      <br>
      This term describes people who relate to aromanticism, but not completely—a sort of gray area in between
      aromanticism and alloromanticism. They may feel romantic attraction very weakly, or under unknown circumstances.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="flagLeft" src="../images/cupioromantic flag.png">
    <p>
      <b>Cupioromantic</b>
      <br>
      Cupioromantic people don't feel romantic attraction, however, they enjoy the idea of romance.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class="flagRight" src="../images/apothiro flag.png">
    <p>
      <b>Apothiromantic</b>
      <br>
      This is sort of like the opposite of cupioromantic! Apothiromantic people don't feel romantic attraction, and they
      are repulsed by romance.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p><b>Notes!</b>
      <br>
    <ul>
      <li>These terms can be paired with others to specify how gender plays a part in your attraction! For example, you
        can be biromantic and demiromantic, or acespec and a lesbian.</li>
      <li>Aromantic people are not necessarily asexual too, and the same goes the other way around! There's nothing
        wrong with being asexual and alloromantic, or aromantic and allosexual.</li>
      <li>Since asexuality is also a spectrum, all the labels above have sexuality counterparts (e.g., demiromanticism's
        counterpart is demisexuality)!</li>
      <li>There are plenty of other less common labels on the aromantic spectrum! <a
          href="https://www.aromanticism.org/en/identity-terms">AUREA's glossary</a> has a list of identity terms with
        sources.</li>
